# hecker
it's just a test and fun file to lock and unlock files
with python



please run this only in those files which you want to destroy (ofc it will bring things back to default but by any chance your file gets corrupted dont blame me )

dont run on any imp  files or it will corrupt it as this programme renames the file format too
